2.	Shall use Visual Studio, Community Edition available at no cost.
3.	Shall provide packages for an Executive, TestHarness, Logger, and FileManager (if needed).
4.	Shall accept a TestRequest XML string defining one or more test elements by naming dynamic link libraries.
5.	Each test element shall contain a testDriver element and one or more testedCode elements.
6.	TestDrivers shall implement an ITest interface1 that declares a test method taking no arguments and returning a boolean value indicating test pass or failure.
7.	On receiving a TestRequest, the TestHarness shall parse the request, load the corresponding libraries, sequentially create instances of each TestDriver, and log pass-fail status of each test, along with a time-date stamp.
8.	Shall provide one or more TestRequests that conduct testing of at least three of your project packages.
